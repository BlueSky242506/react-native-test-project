# inKind RN Test Project

A quick inKind React Native test to ensure React Native programming capabilities.

## Objective

The app in this repo will use a publically available API at [https://dog.ceo/dog-api/](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/) to show a picture of a random dog.

Your objective is to edit this code to let a user see a list of breeds, select a breed, and show the user a picture of that breed, using this API.


## Directions

1. Fork this repo
2. Run the app on iOS & Android (take screenshots as proof that you got it running)
3. Re-write the code to meet the above objective.
4. Run the app on iOS & Android to ensure it works on both operating systems (take screenshots as proof)
5. Send screenshots and link to your fork to miles at inkind dot com, along with the number of hours it took you to complete this challenge and how much you'd charge to complete this task.

Make sure your fork is publically available so that we can clone it to verify the work.
